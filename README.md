# Framer Inventory 3.0 Beta 1 for Sketch 43+
### Framer Inventory integrates Sketch + Framer workflow in your everyday life. Create. Test. Repeat.



# 1. Semantic Import
Choose the layers you’d like to import to Framer and get the code & assets done for you. You can create complex prototypes and keep them up-to-date with semantic import then you gain *not just layers but states*.

## Prepare project
* Create Framer project, *choose device type* and save it.
* Open plugin’s panel via *Plugins/Framer Inventory/Show Panel*
* Select *the same device type* on panel and you are ready!

## How it works
Choose layers and run available import options (panel helps to understand what you’ll get):

### Import Layers
Select one or several layers to get them imported: assets are exported to your Framer project and code is in a clipboard. Paste to Framer and save project to let Framer recognize updated assets:

### Import States
If you have layer with the same name on several artboards, plugin generates layer & states.

### Import Selected States
If you want to generate selected states just select layer & necessary artboards.


## Features:
* Pixels & points support
* Relative layers: get coordinates to parent Artboard or parent Group
* Devices: ready for Desktop/iOS/Android prototyping





# 2. Simulate Scene
Have you used a Keynote for prototyping? It’s quite the same but like you organize scene of slides in Sketch and create motion in Framer with a any logic you need.

## How to use
* Include layers in Scene by marking them exportable
* Generate scene for entire page or selected artboards
* Paste code into Framer and save project

## NEW: Reimporting Scene
Generated code for Scene has several blocks: View, Model and Custom.
*You can write any logic in Custom block and it will be inherited on reimport!*. Now you can test any custom transition with great fidelity, custom curves and ridiculously small amount of time:
